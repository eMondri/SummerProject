Project I'll be working on summer of '22

<h2>Ideas</h2>

Mobile App - For People Who Read Way Too Many Books At Once

lists. you can create lists of books and then mark what chapter you're on. You can also give books a genre tag.

Tabs - "lists" (shows your created lists), "books" (shows your chaptered books), "tags" (shows books you've given a certain tag)

|lists|books|tags| <-- for reference, look at the crunchyroll UI's tab layout scheme

shouldn't be overly complicated, books should be the default home tab, should basically be like a checklist, with a place to input chapter number.
(maybe actually make it a checklist, have a separate area for books you've finished and checked off?)
(also maybe have a separate area for books you've dropped so that you can check out books you've decided not to finish?)
