# SummerProject
Project I'll be working on summer of '22

<b>Ideas</b>

Large map with randomly placed/spaced colored gems. A modified "keep the crown" game, you get points for every second you have a gem on you. Use points to summon minions for defence/attack or for potions for speed

Something similar to/based off of Epic Battle Fantasy 5

ASCII game, like Candy Box, with elements like Undertale & Epic Battle Fantacy 5

Platformer game like Ori & the Will of the Wisps/Ori & the Blind Forest/Hollow Knight with specific stats like those in "system" novels (Everyone Else is a Returnee)
