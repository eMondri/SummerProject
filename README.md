# SummerProject
Project I'll be working on summer of '22

<h2>Ideas</h2>

Large map with randomly placed/spaced colored gems. A modified "keep the crown" game, you get points for every second you have a gem on you. Use points to summon minions for defence/attack or for potions for speed

Something similar to/based off of Epic Battle Fantasy 5

ASCII game, like Candy Box, with elements like Undertale & Epic Battle Fantacy 5

Platformer game like Ori & the Will of the Wisps/Ori & the Blind Forest/Hollow Knight with specific stats like those in "system" novels (Everyone Else is a Returnee)

<h2>Project Outline</h2>

Platformer game with special abilities and unlocks like the Ori games but also with a stat system, maybe like that of Castle Crashers.
Should be 2D & sidescrolling like Mario, but certain maps/scenes should be top-down instead.
No concept of "companions" but can include elements of "racing" to traverse a distance/accoplish a goal in a set period of time (like the races in Ori Will of the Wisps)
Can include a unique combat system like Undertale
